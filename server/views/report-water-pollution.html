    <p>Use this service to report pollution in the sea, lakes, reservoirs, rivers or other watercourses in England.</p>
    <p>Pollution can include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>sewage</li>
      <li>'run-off' from farms</li>
      <li>discharges from industry</li>
      <li>leaks from objects in the river, such as vehicles</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="govuk-inset-text">Thereâ€™s a different way to report <a rel="external" href="https://naturalresources.wales/about-us/contact-us/report-an-incident/?lang=en">water pollution in Wales</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.mygov.scot/report-environmental-incident">water pollution in Scotland</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/information-and-services/environment-and-outdoors/environmental-quality-your-area">water pollution in Northern Ireland</a>.</div>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
    <p>You need to be able to describe the location of the pollution or we will not be able to investigate it.</p>
    <div class="govuk-inset-text">Do not use this service to report littering in rivers. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">Contact your local council</a> instead.</div>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">If you cannot report online</h2>
    <p>You can report the problem to the Environment Agency over the phone.</p>
    <div class="contact">
      <p>Environment Agency incident hotline<br />

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Other problems with your environment</h2>
    <p>How you report other problems affecting the environment depends on the type of problem it is and where it's happening. You may have to report it to:
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the Environment Agency</li>
    <li>your local council</li>
    <li>your utilities company</li>
