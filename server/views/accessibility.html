            This service is run by the Environment Agency. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this
            service. This means you should, for example, be able to:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
            <li>get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>get from the start of the service to the end using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and
                VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            We’ve also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.

            Users of specific technology may experience the following issues when using the service:

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>JAWS screen reader software may not read out all page headings in Internet Explorer 11 – this is a known
                issue with JAWS version 18 or above, we recommend using a different browser to avoid this problem</li>
            <li>Dragon speech recognition software – links that reveal hidden text on a page will not respond to the
                ‘click link’ command, but will respond to ‘click button’ – this is a

            <li>some mapping tools are not accessible for those using assistive technology</li>
            <li>in some situations, the contrast of colours on maps is not high enough to be legible to all users</li>

            <li>several sections of map text do not meet the requirements for WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</li>
